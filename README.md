🌱 This is my custom equivalent of an STL-style `vector` data structure in C++.  
-> I’ve implemented it from scratch with:

-🌸 Custom **allocator** <br/>
-🌸 Custom **iterator** <br/>
-🌸 Manual **memory management** (placement new, destructors) <br/>
-🌸 Support for advanced operations like `emplace_back` using perfect forwarding <br/>
-🌸 Clean, STL-style interface <br/>

I focused heavily on keeping the code **clean**, **efficient**, and **memory-safe**, while sticking close to the design of the real STL `vector`.

This project is a learning-driven implementation meant to mimic **~95%** of STL `vector` behavior and expose how low-level container internals work.
